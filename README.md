# Finite volume method for shallow water equations

The code solves the shallow water equations for a dam break problem using the finite volume method. The the Laxâ€“Friedrichs or Roe methods are used to evaluate the fluxes. The Euler method is used for the explicit time stepping.
The code is for teaching/explanation purposes and is not optimised in any way. 

# Compile

The code requires the Eigen C++ libary. Download the libary and extract its contents to a folder named Eigen inside the includes folder. Once done run make to compile the code. The sw_solver binary will be created in the bin folder. 

# Run

To run the code navigate to the folder of the case e.g. examples/dam_lf and run ./sw_solver dam. The program will solve the dam break problem using the Lax-Friedrichs method for 500 time steps.

The sw_solver binary requires the following files:

- .conf - contains the solver parameters such as timestep, number of timesteps, Riemann solver, etc.
- .grid - contains the grid
